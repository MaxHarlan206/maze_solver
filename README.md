# maze_solver
A simple backtracking algorithm to solve a maze (formatted as a list of lists)
The rules of this maze are that the 'robot' represented by the letter R, can only move right or down 
and has completed the maze when it reaches 'home' represented by the letter 'H'.

Motivation
I made this maze backtracking visualization to begin understanding backtracking and recursion.

How to use?
You can edit the maze by replacing available squares with " " and 'walls' with "X".
This program can either be opened in an IDE or your terminal.
